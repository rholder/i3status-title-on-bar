// Sampler can be used to return a single message on a channel when multiple
// events may have occurred during a configurable time frame. For instance, if
// 1000 messages land in the channel that is used by the running Sampler, only
// one of those messages ever makes it to the onSignal function of Run(). This
// effectively filters out all messages that occur in a given time period and
// allows for a process to only respond when at least one message has appeared
// on the given channel in the period between channel pollings. Additionally,
// because of the blocking nature of channels, we don't need to poll
// continuously, but instead block waiting for at least one sample to appear
// instead of creating a busy wait.

// will begin to flow through the running Sampler with the following behavior:
// at least one message within the given sample frequency will be used to call
// the onSignal function. It is assumed that the Sampler is the only consumer of
// its configured channel and additionally that it will consume all messages
// from the channel when they become available.
